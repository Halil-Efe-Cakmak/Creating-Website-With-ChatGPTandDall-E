# Creating-Website-With-ChatGPTandDall-Ee
The "AI-Powered Portfolio Website" project tasks participants with using AI tools like Canva, DALL-E, and Artbreeder to create visuals and texts for an HTML-based site. Semantic HTML elements should structure the site, with optional responsiveness for different devices. This project explores AI's role in web design and content creation.
